# AngularJS based webapplication for message sending.

Nothing special, just a small app for my university course.
The webapp is based on [Angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed).
To get the app working you should follow the instructions on the seed page.
What you should do is simply give the following commnads in your shell in the project root.

npm install

To start the webserver use the following command
npm start

# Requirements
NODEjs, setting up is pretty straightforward.

## Usage
After the environment is set up, the app is reachable via localhost:8000/app url.
For the first time you should register with a username and a password.
After that simply log in and messages can be send. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALWAYS LOG OUT after you are done.
Otherwise the server needs to be redeployed and all the data will be lost. So reregistering will be neccessary.
